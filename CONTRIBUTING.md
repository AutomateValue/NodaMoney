# How to contribute
Contributions are essential for keeping NodaMoney great. It's impossible for us to be experts in every currency in each country.

If you have a great idea or found a possible bug in NodaMoney, please report this to as a [Issue](https://github.com/remyvd/NodaMoney/issues).
After 15 min this also shown on our [Dashboard](https://trello.com/b/i5L3i4tp/nodamoney) so we can keep a eye on it.

Do you want to contribute with code changes, there are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a
chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork the repository on GitHub (we use the [fork & pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests))
* We use as branching strategy the [Gitflow Workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). so don't
  work directly on the `master` branch! Only target the `develop` branch.

## Making Changes
* Make commits of logical units
* Make sure your commit messages have a good description.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
* Push your changes to  your fork of the repository.
* Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to the NodaMoney repository.
* If needed we will give feedback about the pull request or accept it right away.
